# MLNavMesh (Magic Leap NavMesh)
This is a project that implements the [Unity NavMeshComponents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents) in the [Magic Leap Toolkit Unity](https://github.com/magicleap/Magic-Leap-Toolkit-Unity) SDK. It generates NavMesh surfaces and OffMeshLinks on the meshes generated by the ML Spatial Mapper.

Bot(AI) code is taken from my other project, the [Unity RSToolkit](https://github.com/richardschembri/UnityRSToolkit).

NavMeshLink code is based on [this forum post](https://forum.unity.com/threads/navmesh-links-generator-for-navmeshcomponents.515143/).
